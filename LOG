From lcc 3.0 to 3.1:

Errors fixed:

Died with an assertion failure when a constant was cast to void in a
return statement, eg, f() { return (void)4; }.

Died with an assertion failure when -b was specified.

When -n was specified, issued meaningless diagnostic
"illegal character `\00'" beyond the end of the input.

Erroneously issued "unclosed comment" followed by spurious diagnostics
when spaces in long comments spanned input buffer boundaries.

Line numbers suffered one extra, incorrect increment when long
comments or string literals spanned input buffer boundaries.

On the MIPS, generated code that wouldn't assemble for calls to huge
numeric constant addresses, like ((void (*)())0xbfc00010)().
