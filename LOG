There's a new v3.0 lcc

On the MIPS, initialized arrays were going into the "short data"
segment and exhausting it too fast.  They're now back in the "long
data" segment where they belong.

On the MIPS, generated an assembler diagnostic and then incorrect code
for struct copies when the size%4 was 2 or 3.

On the MIPS, silently generated incorrect code for main(){struct
{...}*f(),x; x=*f();}

On the SPARC, silently generated incorrect code to copy structs and
initialize arrays when the size was exactly 4096 bytes.
