From lcc 3.6 to 4.0:

Changes:

on the SPARC, lcc now emits .type and .size directives unconditionally.

Errors fixed:

-A -A erroneously complained about static main's that didn't conform to
the ANSI-mandated `int main(void)' or `int main(int, char **)'.

Generated incorrect values in some expressions with constant pointers.

on the SPARC, erroneously reused a register variable as a temporary when
the variable is compiler-generated.

on the SPARC with -b, emitted incorrect code for returning structs.
