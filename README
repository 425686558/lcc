This hierarchy is the distribution for a BETA version of lcc 4.0.  Only
the Alpha and `symbolic' back ends are available at this time.

lcc version 3.5 is described in the book `A Retargetable C Compiler:
Design and Implementation' (Addison-Wesley, 1995, ISBN 0-8053-1670-1).
There are significant differences between 3.5 and 4.0, most notably in
the intermediate code. This beta 4.0 version is provided `as-is'.

VERSION 4.0 IS INCOMPATIBLE WITH EARLIER VERSIONS OF LCC. DO NOT UNLOAD
THIS DISTRIBUTION ON TOP OF A 3.X DISTRIBUTION.

doc/install.ps is a PostScript file that gives complete description of
the distribution and installation instructions. This file was generated
from the HTML document doc/install.html. doc/install.txt is a plain
ASCII version of these instructions. NB: THESE FILES ARE FOR LCC
VERSION 3.5 AND THUS CONTAIN SOME EXTRANEOUS INFORMATION.

To build lcc with the Alpha/OSF C compiler, use the -std1 option, e.g.,

	% cd alpha/osf
	% make -f ../../src/makefile CC="cc -std1"

uses cc to build alpha/osf/rcc. If you forget -std1, rcc will crash.
