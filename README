This hierarchy is the distribution for lcc version 4.0.

lcc version 3.x is described in the book `A Retargetable C Compiler:
Design and Implementation' (Addison-Wesley, 1995, ISBN 0-8053-1670-1).
There are significant differences between 3.x and 4.0, most notably in
the intermediate code.

VERSION 4.0 IS INCOMPATIBLE WITH EARLIER VERSIONS OF LCC. DO NOT UNLOAD
THIS DISTRIBUTION ON TOP OF A 3.X DISTRIBUTION.

LOG describes the changes since the last release.

CPYRIGHT describes the conditions under you can use, copy, modify, and
distribute lcc or works derived from lcc.

doc/install.html is an HTML file that gives a complete description of
the distribution and installation instructions.

To build lcc with the Alpha/OSF C compiler, use the -std1 option, e.g.,

	% cd alpha/osf
	% make CC="cc -std1"

uses cc to build alpha/osf/rcc. If you forget -std1, rcc will crash.
